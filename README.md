# Stock-Analysis-Scraper-2024

Scraper of all statistical tables for all companies on Stock Analysis for every date, including the closing price of their shares on the stock market for the given date and the following quarter. This is very useful for later applying Machine Learning techniques.

This scraper will generate a massive database. Iâ€™ve cleaned up null values, outliers, and variable issues. The null-free database with all its useful rows and columns is available for direct download. Since the database is quite large, I have compressed it into a zip file, although its original format is CSV.

Additionally, I attach a PDF with the analysis of the generated database that we presented for a university project, where we obtained an average theoretical profitability of 17% per quarter.
